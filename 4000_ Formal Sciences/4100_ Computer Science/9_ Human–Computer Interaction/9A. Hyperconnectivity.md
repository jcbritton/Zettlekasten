[[1. Anomie as the Current Zeitgeist]]
[[1.1 The Ontological Obsession and Cosmogony]]

Mircea Eliade, a historian of religion, focused on the human need for meaning through sacred myths and rituals, arguing that modern societies often experience anomie—a sense of normlessness and disconnection—due to the loss of these sacred frameworks. His work, like *The Sacred and the Profane*, suggests that without a sense of the sacred, people struggle to find coherence in a fragmented world. Hyperconnectivity in the modern age, driven by digital networks and instant communication, amplifies this by flooding us with competing ideologies, information overload, and eroded traditional structures—creating what you might call ideological flux.

Eliade's "ontological obsession" refers to humanity’s drive to anchor existence in a stable, sacred reality, often through myths that give life meaning. Hyperconnectivity disrupts this by flattening sacred hierarchies into a chaotic, relativistic stew of ideas, where no single narrative holds dominance. So, while Eliade didn’t cause this flux, his framework helps explain why the disorienting speed and scale of modern connectivity deepen anomie: we’re unmoored from shared myths, adrift in a sea of transient ideologies.

That said, Eliade’s lens might be too narrow. He romanticized the sacred and underestimated how secular systems—like science or nationalism—can also provide meaning. Hyperconnectivity’s chaos isn’t just ontological; it’s also practical, driven by economic, political, and technological forces he didn’t fully anticipate. His ideas are a useful starting point, but they don’t fully account for the complexity of today’s networked world.
