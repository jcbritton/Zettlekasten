## Satan's Chief Purpose in the world is to distract us from remembrance of God
That's why the Virgin Mary was able to serve the mystery of Christ with such immaculate purity because...she never allowed her though to depart from the memory of God. 
And this is what the Jesus Prayer, Hesychasm, etc., are all about.
