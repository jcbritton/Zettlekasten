Sacred trees are often guarded by monsters (griffins, dragons, snakes) which indicates an initiatory ordeal of the heroic type - because it is only by violence that the victor obtains the fruit of the sacred tree.[^1] <font color="#00b050">The kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.</font>[^2]
