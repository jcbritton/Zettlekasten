Faithful repetition of divine models has a twofold result: 
1. By imitating the gods, man remains in the sacred, and hence, in reality
2. By the continuous reactualization of paradigmatic divine gestures, the world is sanctified
Man's religious behavior contributes to maintaining the sanctity of the world.[^1]
