[[1.2 The Ontological Obsession is sacred and being]]
[[1.1 The Ontological Obsession and Cosmogony]]

Creation is accomplished by a surplus of ontological substance - out of love in the case of Christianity. The ontological substance is love - being is love.[^1] (Being as Communion - Zizioulis)[^2]

<font color="#ff0000">If God is love, and being is love, then by the transitive property - God is being. God being love is Christ on the Cross and this becomes the paradigmatic model for all human activities, for it alone reveals the real (reality), the superabundant, the effectual. To take upon yourself the burden, the suffering of the other.
If then also, as J.D. Zizioulis says, being is as through communion, then communion is love and this is how we manifest Christ through the Holy Spirit as Christ Manifests the Father. In communion we are repeating the divine model and manifesting the Trinity.</font>

Thus the paradigmatic model is "fixed" by myth for all rites and significant human activities - eating, sexuality, work, education, and so on.
