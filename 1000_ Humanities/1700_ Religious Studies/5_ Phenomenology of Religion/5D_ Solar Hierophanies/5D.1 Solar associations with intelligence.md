The moon confers a religious valorization on cosmic becoming and reconciles man to death. The sun reveals a different mode of existence, does not share in becoming. It is being and gives expression to the religious values of autonomy and power, or sovereignty, of intelligence. This is why in certain cultures we witness a process of solarization of the supreme beings. Many heroic myths are solar in structure. Like the sun he fights darkness, descends into the realm of death and emerges victorious. in the end solar sun and intelligence will be assimilated to such a degree that the solar and syncretistic theologies of the end of antiquity become rationalistic philosophies; the sun is proclaimed to be the intelligence of the world. 

Solar hierophanies give place to *ideas* and religious feeling almost completely disappears after this long process of rationalization. 

This desacrylization of the solar hierophanies serves, as it does in the desacrylization of other aspects of human life, to finally empty the cosmos of its religious content.[^1]
