[[2.1 The Ontological Substance is Love]]
[[1.2 The Ontological Obsession is sacred and being]]

Primitive or ancient man assumes immense responsibility in collaborating in the creation of the cosmos, or of creating his own world but it is a responsibility on the cosmic plane in contradistinction to the moral, social, or historical responsibilities that are alone regarded as valid in modern civilizations. Profane man feels no responsibility except to himself and to society. For profane man, the universe does not properly constitute a cosmos, a living articulated unity. It is simply the sum of the material reserves and physical energies of the planet, and the great concern of modern man is to avoid stupidly exhausting the economic resources of the globe. But existentially, the primative always puts himself in a cosmic context. His personal experience lacks neither genuineness or depth; but the fact that it is expressed in a language unfamiliar to us makes it appear spurious or infantile.[^1]
