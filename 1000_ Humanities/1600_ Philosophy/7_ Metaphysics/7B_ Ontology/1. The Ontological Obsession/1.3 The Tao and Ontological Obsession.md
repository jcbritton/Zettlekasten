C.S. Lewis's Tao must be equivalent to the apperception of an individual with an ontological obsession, and experience of the sacred reality. Religious man, to quote Eliade. But this man is participating in being not embracing becoming. 

<font color="#00b050">If apperception is constituted of fundamental aspects of intersubjective reality, as Edmund Husserl's phenomenology asserts, then the intersubjective reality of religious man, one who is in the Tao, is sacred reality. </font>
